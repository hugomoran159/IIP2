|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Check Evidence version | `npm view @evidence-dev/evidence version` |
| Check NodeJS version | `node -v` |

No Results

# [Common Issues](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#common-issues)

## [Installation](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#installation)

### [Not able to run `npm install`](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#not-able-to-run-npm-install)

This is often related to the version of NodeJS your app is using. See [system requirements](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/system-requirements) for more information

### [Installation taking a long time](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#installation-taking-a-long-time)

On Windows, the initial installation can take up to a few minutes. If it has been longer than 10 minutes and your app hasn't started, [reach out in the Slack community for help](https://slack.evidence.dev/)

## [Data Sources](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#data-sources)

### [Data is not available for querying](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#data-is-not-available-for-querying)

Ensure that you've done the following:

- Add `.sql` files to your `sources/my-source` directory to define which data to bring into Evidence (does not apply to the CSV connector, which does not require `.sql` files)
- Run `npm run sources` to load the data

To check whether your data has been successfully loaded into your app, go to the `/explore/schema` page to see which data is in your app.

### [Failure in `npm run sources`](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#failure-in-npm-run-sources)

If you're having problems loading data with `npm run sources`, try using `npm run sources -- --debug` to display additional logs

## [Page Loading](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#page-loading)

If you are running into a problem on your page, but are not seeing a clear error message, try looking in your browser console to see if there is additional information available.

To open your browser console:

- Right click anywhere on your page
- Click "Inspect" - the browser dev tools pane should open
- Click the "Console" tab - this will display warnings and errors generated by your page

This is helpful information to provide when asking questions in slack or creating issues on Github.

## [Deployment](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/troubleshooting\#deployment)

If you have issues when building or deploying your app, try running `npm run build` locally to see if the behaviour is the same as in your deployment environment.

If the build works locally, but not in your deployment environment, check that the NodeJS version used in your deployment environment fits within the [system requirements](https://docs.evidence.dev/guides/system-requirements).
