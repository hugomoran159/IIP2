# [What is Evidence?](https://docs.evidence.dev/\#what-is-evidence)

Evidence is an open source framework for building data products with SQL - things like reports, decision-support tools, and embedded dashboards. It's a code-driven alternative to drag-and-drop BI tools.

This docs site is an Evidence app.

Install Evidence with the [VSCode Extension](vscode:extension/Evidence.evidence-vscode), or see other [installation options](https://docs.evidence.dev/install-evidence).

## [How does Evidence work?](https://docs.evidence.dev/\#how-does-evidence-work)

![](https://docs.evidence.dev/img/how-it-works.png)

Evidence renders a BI website from markdown files:

1. [Data sources](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/data-sources) can include data warehouses, flat files and non-SQL data sources
2. [SQL statements](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/queries) inside markdown files run queries against data sources
3. [Charts and components](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/components) are rendered using these query results
4. [Templated pages](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/templated-pages) generate many pages from a single markdown template
5. [Loops](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/loops) and [If / Else](https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/if-else) statements allow control of what is displayed to users

## [Pre-requisites](https://docs.evidence.dev/\#pre-requisites)

To use Evidence you need to know SQL. A knowledge of [basic markdown syntax](https://docs.evidence.dev/reference/markdown) is also helpful.
